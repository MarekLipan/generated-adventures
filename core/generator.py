def _build_scene_generation_prompt_rules() -> str:
    """Returns the common rules section for scene generation prompts."""
    return """
After the scene narrative, provide a prompt for player interaction. The prompt should be:
- Either for the entire party or a specific character
- One of three types:
  * dialogue: Character should speak (player enters text in quotes)
  * action: Player describes what they do (for simple, non-risky actions)
  * dice_check: Player must roll dice (for ANY risky action, test of skill, or combat)

CRITICAL RULES FOR PROMPT TYPES - VARY THE PROMPTS:
- DO NOT use dice_check for every scene - mix dialogue, action, and dice_check
- Use dialogue when: characters need to talk to NPCs, negotiate, roleplay conversations
- Use action for: simple tasks, exploration without immediate danger, planning, easy skill checks, or coordinated team efforts
- Use dice_check for: combat, risky actions, difficult skill checks, life-or-death situations

DICE CHECK RULES (when using dice_check type):
- ALWAYS single die roll (either d6 or d10)
- Choose dice type based on difficulty:
  * d6: Simple to moderate challenges (lockpicking, climbing, basic combat)
  * d10: Challenging situations (difficult combat, dangerous magic, persuading hostile NPCs)
- Remember: The next scene will interpret the roll with stat modifiers (+2 for 16-20, +1 for 11-15, +0 for 6-10, -1 for 1-5) and skill bonuses
- Each character targeted will roll their own single die

TARGETING RULES (CRITICAL - READ CAREFULLY):
For dice_check prompts specifically:
  * ALWAYS specify target_character (single name) OR target_characters (array of names)
  * NEVER use target_character: null for dice_check prompts - this causes confusion about who rolls
  * If one character should attempt the check, use target_character with their name
    - Example: "target_character": "Theron the Brave" (use the ACTUAL character name from the party)
  * If multiple specific characters should roll simultaneously, use target_characters array
    - Example: "target_characters": ["ActualName1", "ActualName2"] (use ACTUAL names from the party roster)
  * If the situation is "any character could volunteer," pick the most suitable character based on their skills/stats
    - Example: For persuasion, pick the character with highest Intelligence or relevant skills
  * Make your prompt_text match your targeting:
    - Single target: "[CharacterName], roll d10 to persuade the elder" (use their actual name)
    - Multiple targets: "[Name1] and [Name2], both roll d6 for your attacks" (use their actual names)

For action prompts:
  * Can use target_character for single character actions
  * Can use target_characters for coordinated multi-character actions (e.g., "[Name1] searches left, [Name2] searches right" - use actual party member names)
  * Use target_character: null when the entire party acts together

For dialogue prompts:
  * Use target_character with a name to address a specific character
  * Use target_character: null when the entire party speaks/responds
  
CRITICAL: For ANY dice_check prompt, you MUST set either target_character (string) or target_characters (array). Never null.

CRITICAL RULES FOR CHARACTER UPDATES:
- ALWAYS return updated_characters array with ALL party members
- Re-generate complete character data (stats, health, skills, inventory) based on what happened in the scene
- Update current_health for characters who took damage or were healed (keep stats same unless permanently changed)
- Update skills if a character learns a new ability or loses one (rare, but possible)
- Update inventory to reflect items gained, lost, used, or consumed
- If nothing happened to a character, return them unchanged
- Keep backstory, appearance, and personality the same (these don't change during adventures)

CRITICAL RULES FOR GAME STATUS (REQUIRED FIELD):
- ALWAYS include game_status in your response - it is a REQUIRED field
- Set game_status to "ongoing" (default) - continue the adventure normally
- Set game_status to "failed" if ANY character reaches 0 current_health (party death/defeat):
  * This ends the game immediately with a game over
  * The scene should describe their defeat or death dramatically
  * Still provide a prompt field (required by schema), but it won't be shown to players
- Set game_status to "completed" ONLY when the main quest objective is definitively achieved:
  * The primary goal from scenario_details must be fulfilled
  * This ends the game with a victory screen
  * The scene should describe their triumph and resolution
  * Still provide a prompt field (required by schema), but it won't be shown to players
- Do NOT set completed prematurely - minor victories are still "ongoing"
- Do NOT set completed just because things are going well - only when main quest is done

CRITICAL RULES FOR HANDLING PLAYER ACTIONS:
- If player attempts an IMPOSSIBLE action (using items they don't have, doing something beyond their character's capabilities, breaking world logic):
  * DO NOT allow the action to succeed
  * In scene_text, explain why it's not possible
  * Prompt them to try something different (use "action" type prompt)
  * Example: "You reach for the magic sword, but you don't have such an item. What do you do instead?"

- If player describes an action that should undergo a test or challenge:
  * DO NOT resolve it immediately
  * Prompt for dice_check to determine success/failure
  * Examples: attacking, dodging, climbing, lockpicking, persuading, searching, casting difficult spells

- COMBAT and FIGHTING scenarios MUST use dice_check prompts:
  * Any attack, defense, or combat maneuver requires dice
  * Multiple characters in combat should each get dice_check prompts
  * Never auto-resolve combat without dice rolls
"""


def _build_dice_check_resolution_rules() -> str:
    """Returns rules for resolving dice check results."""
    return """
CRITICAL RULES FOR DICE CHECK RESOLUTION:
When the previous prompt was a dice_check and the player provides their roll result(s):

NOTE: For multi-character dice checks, the player will provide rolls in format: "CharacterName1: 7, CharacterName2: 4"
Parse each character's roll separately and apply their individual modifiers.

1. INTERPRET THE ROLL with character stat modifiers:
   - For PHYSICAL actions (combat, climbing, swimming, breaking): Apply STRENGTH modifier
     * Strength 16-20: +2 to roll
     * Strength 11-15: +1 to roll
     * Strength 6-10: +0 to roll
     * Strength 1-5: -1 to roll
   
   - For MENTAL actions (arcane knowledge, puzzle solving, investigation): Apply INTELLIGENCE modifier
     * Intelligence 16-20: +2 to roll
     * Intelligence 11-15: +1 to roll
     * Intelligence 6-10: +0 to roll
     * Intelligence 1-5: -1 to roll
   
   - For DEXTERITY actions (lockpicking, dodging, stealth, acrobatics): Apply AGILITY modifier
     * Agility 16-20: +2 to roll
     * Agility 11-15: +1 to roll
     * Agility 6-10: +0 to roll
     * Agility 1-5: -1 to roll
   
   - For SOCIAL actions (persuasion, intimidation, deception): Apply INTELLIGENCE modifier (wit/charisma)

2. APPLY SKILL BONUSES:
   - If the character has a relevant skill, add +1 to the final result
   - Examples: "Lockpicking" skill for picking locks, "Swordsmanship" for melee combat, "Persuasion" for social checks

3. DETERMINE SUCCESS:
   - Calculate: Roll + Stat Modifier + Skill Bonus (if applicable)
   - For d6 checks: 4+ is success, 6+ is critical success, 2 or less is critical failure
   - For d10 checks: 6+ is success, 9+ is critical success, 3 or less is critical failure
   - Note: Always single die roll, so modifiers are very impactful

4. NARRATE THE RESULT:
   - ALWAYS mention the dice type that was rolled (d6 or d10) to provide context
   - Show the roll value as a fraction to make success/failure clear to players
   - Explicitly mention the stat modifier and skill bonus in your narrative
   - Example formats:
     * "You rolled 4/6. With your high Strength (+2) and Swordsmanship skill (+1), that's a total of 7 - a solid success!"
     * "You rolled 3/10. Despite your Agility modifier (+1), bringing you to 4, you barely manage..."
     * "A natural 6/6! With your Intelligence bonus (+2), that's a perfect 8 - critical success!"
     * "You rolled 2/10. Even with your skill bonus (+1), you only reach 3 - a critical failure..."
   - The fraction format (roll/max) helps players immediately understand if it was a good or bad roll
   - Make outcomes dramatic and descriptive
   - Critical successes should have extra benefits
   - Critical failures should have interesting consequences

5. UPDATE CHARACTER STATE:
   - Successful combat: Enemy takes damage, may gain items/information
   - Failed combat: Character loses health (appropriate to danger level)
   - Successful skill checks: Progress story, gain items/allies/knowledge
   - Failed skill checks: Setbacks, complications, but not instant death unless extremely dangerous

SCENARIO: {scenario_name}

SCENARIO DETAILS:

PARTY CHARACTER SHEETS:
{character_sheets}

Generate the opening scene for this adventure. Create an engaging, atmospheric introduction that:

CRITICAL FOR OPENING SCENE:
1. **Establish how the party came together**: Briefly narrate how these characters met and why they're working together
   - Use their backstories to create natural connections (shared goals, chance meeting, hired together, etc.)
   - Make it believable based on their personalities and backgrounds
   - Keep this part concise (2-3 sentences)

2. **Explain the current situation**: Describe what brings them to this specific moment
   - Where are they? (refer to the setting from scenario details)
   - Why are they here? (connect to the main quest)
   - What immediate situation do they find themselves in?

3. **Introduce the main quest naturally**: Players don't know the scenario details, so reveal the quest/goal through the narrative
   - Don't assume players know anything from the DM notes
   - Make the objective clear through dialogue, events, or circumstances
   - Give them a reason to care and a clear direction

4. **Set the scene and mood**: Create atmosphere with vivid descriptions
   - Describe the environment, sounds, smells, lighting
   - Build tension or intrigue appropriate to the scenario

5. **Introduce party members naturally**: Reference characters by name, appearance, and personality
   - Show their personalities through brief actions or reactions
   - Consider their backstories when describing how they interact
   - Be aware of their stats, health, skills, and inventory

6. **End with a clear hook**: Give players an immediate decision or action to take

REMEMBER: This is the first thing players experience. They need to understand:
- Who they are (as a group)
- Where they are
- What their goal/quest is
- What they should do next

Generate the next scene in this adventure. The scene should:
1. Respond naturally to the player's action (if provided)
2. Advance the story toward the main quest
3. Introduce new challenges, discoveries, or NPCs as appropriate
4. Maintain tension and engagement
5. Reference party members when relevant (consider their backstories, appearance, personality, skills, and capabilities)
6. Be aware of their CURRENT stats, health, skills, and inventory - check if they actually have items they try to use
7. Adjust challenge difficulty based on party's current health and capabilities
8. Create opportunities for characters to use their unique skills
